Although unnamed in 2 Maccabees, she is known variously as Hannah,&nbsp;Miriam,&nbsp;and Solomonia.&nbsp;2 Maccabees states that shortly before the revolt of&nbsp;<a title="Judas Maccabeus" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_Maccabeus">Judas Maccabeus</a>&nbsp;(2 Maccabees 8),&nbsp;<a title="Antiochus IV Epiphanes" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiochus_IV_Epiphanes">Antiochus IV Epiphanes</a>&nbsp;arrested a mother and her seven sons, and tried to force them to eat&nbsp;<a title="Pork" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pork">pork</a>.

The latter section included a brief discussion of the "Jewish problem" (<em>Problem żydowski</em>): "So long as Jews remain Jews, a Jewish problem exists and will continue to exist (...) It is a fact that Jews are waging war against the Catholic church, that they are steeped in free-thinking, and constitute the vanguard of atheism, the Bolshevik movement, and revolutionary activity. It is a fact that Jews have a corruptive influence on morals and that their publishing houses are spreading pornography. It is true that Jews are perpetrating fraud, practicing usury, and dealing in prostitution. It is true that, from a religious and ethical point of view, Jewish youth are having a negative influence on the Catholic youth in our schools."&nbsp;Hlond tempered these remarks with an admission that "not all Jews are this way" and forbade assaults on Jews or attacks on their property. Yet, despite a warning to Catholics not to take an anti-Jewish moral stance, interspersed in the letter's words of friendship was an explicit condemnation of Jewish culture and also Judaism for its rejection of&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Christ" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ">Jesus Christ</a>: "It is good to prefer your own kind when shopping, to avoid Jewish stores and Jewish stalls in the marketplace (...) One should stay away from the harmful moral influence of Jews, keep away from their anti-Christian culture, and especially boycott the Jewish press and demoralizing Jewish publications. (...) We do not honor the indescribable tragedy of that nation, which was the guardian of the idea of the&nbsp;<a class="mw-redirect" title="Christ" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ">Messiah</a>&nbsp;and from which was born the Savior. When divine mercy enlightens a Jew to sincerely accept his and our Messiah, let us greet him into our Christian ranks with joy."&nbsp;Hlond's letter was criticized by Polish Jewish groups who saw it as offering support and a rationalization for antisemitism.&nbsp;What also caught the attention of historians was the remark about not hating anyone, "not even Jews", implying "not even enemies". Were Jews to be loved as neighbors or enemies?&nbsp;However, while Hlond promoted the expulsion of German civilians after World War II, he had always consistently condemned the Nazi persecution of the Jews.</dd>

<dd>Let us pray also for the Jews: that almighty God may remove the veil from their hearts; so that they too may acknowledge Jesus Christ our Lord. Let us pray. Let us kneel. Arise. Almighty and eternal God, who dost also not exclude from thy mercy the Jews: hear our prayers, which we offer for the blindness of that people; that acknowledging the light of thy Truth, which is Christ, they may be delivered from their darkness. Through the same our Lord Jesus Christ, who liveth and reigneth with thee in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, for ever and ever.

"It seems that the interest of the Zionist movement, however, is to inflate this figure [of Holocaust deaths] so that their gains will be greater. This led them to emphasize this figure [six million] in order to gain the solidarity of international public opinion with Zionism.

I quoted an argument between historians in which various numbers of casualties were mentioned. One wrote there were 12&nbsp;million victims and another wrote there were 800,000. I have no desire to argue with the figures. The Holocaust was a terrible, unforgivable crime against the Jewish nation, a crime against humanity that cannot be accepted by humankind.

<dd>In 1988, the American historian&nbsp;<a title="Arno J. Mayer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arno_J._Mayer">Arno J. Mayer</a>&nbsp;published a book entitled&nbsp;<em>Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?</em>, which did not explicitly deny the Holocaust, but lent support to Holocaust denial by stating that most people who died at&nbsp;<a title="Auschwitz concentration camp" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auschwitz_concentration_camp">Auschwitz</a>&nbsp;were the victims of "natural causes" such as disease, not gassing.&nbsp;Mayer also cited the works of Holocaust deniers&nbsp;<a title="Arthur Butz" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Butz">Arthur Butz</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Paul Rassinier" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Rassinier">Paul Rassinier</a>&nbsp;in his book's bibliography. Critics such as&nbsp;<a title="Lucy Dawidowicz" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Dawidowicz">Lucy Dawidowicz</a>&nbsp;criticized Mayer's citation of deniers, and argued that his statements about Auschwitz were factually incorrect.&nbsp;Holocaust expert&nbsp;<a title="Robert Jan van Pelt" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Jan_van_Pelt">Robert Jan van Pelt</a>&nbsp;has noted that Mayer's book is as close as a mainstream historian has ever come to supporting Holocaust denial.&nbsp;Holocaust deniers such as&nbsp;<a title="David Irving" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Irving">David Irving</a>&nbsp;have often cited Mayer's book as one reason for embracing Holocaust denial.&nbsp;Though Mayer has been often condemned for his statement about the reasons for the Auschwitz death toll, his book does not deny the use of gas chambers at Auschwitz, as Holocaust deniers often claim.</dd>
<dd>Some mainstream Holocaust historians have labeled Mayer a denier. The Israeli historian&nbsp;<a title="Yehuda Bauer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yehuda_Bauer">Yehuda Bauer</a>&nbsp;wrote that Mayer "popularizes the nonsense that the Nazis saw in Marxism and Bolshevism their main enemy, and the Jews unfortunately got caught up in this; when he links the destruction of the Jews to the ups and downs of German warfare in the Soviet Union, in a book that is so cocksure of itself that it does not need a proper scientific apparatus, he is really engaging in a much more subtle form of Holocaust denial".</dd>
<dd>Defenders of Mayer argue that his statement that "Sources for the study of the gas chambers at once rare and unreliable" has been taken out of context, particularly by Holocaust deniers.&nbsp;<a title="Michael Shermer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Shermer">Michael Shermer</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Alex Grobman" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Grobman">Alex Grobman</a>&nbsp;observe that the paragraph from which the statement is taken asserts that the SS destroyed the majority of the documentation relating to the operation of the gas chambers in the death camps, which is why Mayer feels that sources for the operation of the gas chambers are "rare" and "unreliable".</dd>

Lee argues that even if the Flatbush brothers are stereotyped figures, their "10 minutes of screen time" is insignificant when compared to "100 years of Hollywood cinema... [and] a slew of really racist, anti-Semitic filmmakers". According to Lee, his status as a successful African-American artist has led to hostility and unfair treatment: "Don't hold me to a higher moral standard than the rest of my filmmaking colleagues... Now that young black filmmakers have arisen in the film industry, all of a sudden stereotypes are a big issue... I think it's reaching the point where&nbsp;<em>I'm</em>&nbsp;getting reviewed, not my films." Ultimately, however, Lee refused to apologize for his portrayal of the Flatbush brothers: "I stand behind all my work, including my characters, Moe and Josh Flatbush... if critics are telling me that to avoid charges of anti-Semitism, all Jewish characters I write have to be model citizens, and not one can be a villain, cheat or a crook, and that no Jewish people have ever exploited black artists in the history of the entertainment industry, that's unrealistic and unfair."</dd>

<dd>The book was criticized for being antisemitic, and for failing to provide an objective analysis of the role of Jews in the slave trade.

<dd>Historian Ralph A.

The riots began on 19 August 1991, after two children of&nbsp;<a title="Guyana" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyana">Guyanese</a>&nbsp;immigrants were unintentionally struck by an automobile in the motorcade of&nbsp;<a title="Menachem Mendel Schneerson" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menachem_Mendel_Schneerson">Menachem Mendel Schneerson</a>, the&nbsp;<a title="Rebbe" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebbe">leader of a Jewish religious sect</a>. One child died and the second was severely injured. This event was said to cause tensions between Jewish and black residents to erupt.</dd>
<dd>In its wake, several Jews were seriously injured; one Orthodox Jewish man was killed; and a non-Jewish man, apparently mistaken by rioters for a Jew, was killed by a group of black men. The riots were a major issue in the 1993 mayoral race, contributing to the defeat of Mayor&nbsp;<a title="David Dinkins" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Dinkins">David Dinkins</a>, an African American, who was blamed for an ineffective police response.

The association's May 1991 statement was in response to an incident where certain of its members had questioned the reality of the Holocaust. The December 1991 declaration is a reversal of the AHA's earlier stance that the association should not set a precedent by certifying historical facts.</dd>

In this poem, Eliot wrote, "The rats are underneath the piles. / The jew is underneath the lot. / Money in furs."&nbsp;Interpreting the line as an indirect comparison of Jews to rats, Julius writes, "The anti-Semitism is unmistakable.

In June 1999, a&nbsp;<a title="Munich" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich">Munich</a>&nbsp;court found this statement to be "minimizing the Holocaust, which caused the deaths of six million Jews," and convicted and fined Le Pen for his remarks.&nbsp;Le Pen retorted ironically: "I understand now that it's the Second World War which is a detail of the history of the gas chambers."</dd>

The court ruled that the Irving's claim of libel relating to English defamation law and Holocaust denial was not valid because his deliberate distortion of evidence has been shown to be substantially true. English libel law puts the burden of proof on the defence, meaning that it was up to Lipstadt and her publisher to prove that her claims of Irving's deliberate misrepresentation of evidence to conform to his ideological viewpoints were substantially true. Lipstadt hired British-Jewish lawyer Anthony Julius while Penguin hired libel experts Kevin Bays and Mark Bateman of media law firm Davenport Lyons. Richard J. Evans, an established historian, was hired by the defence to serve as an expert witness. Evans spent two years examining Irving's work, and presented evidence of Irving's misrepresentations, including evidence that Irving had knowingly used forged documents as source material. Upon mutual agreement, the case was argued as a bench trial before Mr. Justice Charles Gray, who produced a written judgment 333 pages long in favour of the defendants, in which he detailed Irving's systematic distortion of the historical record of World War II.</dd>

We are proud of our long-standing relationship with the&nbsp;<a title="American Jews" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Jews">Jewish community</a>&nbsp;and I personally will not tolerate statements that run counter to the history and beliefs of the NAACP in that regard."</dd>
<dd>Alcorn, who had been suspended three times in the previous five years for misconduct, subsequently resigned from the NAACP and started his own organization called the Coalition for the Advancement of Civil Rights.

<dd>At the 17th meeting of the International Liaison Committee in&nbsp;<a title="New York City" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City">New York</a>, Catholic Church officials state that they will change how Judaism is dealt with in Catholic seminaries and schools. In part, they state:</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>The curricula of Catholic seminaries and schools of theology should reflect the central importance of the Church's new understanding of its relationship to Jews....Courses on Bible, developments by which both the Church and rabbinic Judaism emerged from early Judaism will establish a substantial foundation for ameliorating "the painful ignorance of the history and traditions of Judaism of which only negative aspects and often caricature seem to form part of the stock ideas of many Christians".&nbsp;</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>...Courses dealing with the biblical, historical and theological aspects of relations between Jews and Christians should be an integral part of the seminary and theologate curriculum, and not merely electives. All who graduate from Catholic seminaries and theology schools should have studied the revolution in Catholic teaching on Jews and Judaism from&nbsp;<em><a title="Nostra aetate" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nostra_aetate">Nostra aetate</a></em>&nbsp;to the prayer of Pope John Paul II in Jerusalem at the Western Wall on 26 March 2000....For historic reasons, many Jews find it difficult to overcome generational memories of anti-Semitic oppression. Therefore: Lay and Religious Jewish leaders need to advocate and promote a program of education in our Jewish schools and seminaries &ndash; about the history of Catholic-Jewish relations and knowledge of Christianity and its relationship to Judaism....Encouragement of dialogue between the two faiths does involve recognition, understanding and respect for each other's beliefs, without having to accept them. It is particularly important that Jewish schools teach about the&nbsp;<a title="Second Vatican Council" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Vatican_Council">Second Vatican Council</a>, and subsequent documents and attitudinal changes that opened new perspectives and possibilities for both faiths.</dd>

<blockquote>
<p>one of the most troublesome texts, relative to anti-Semitic potential, that any of us had seen in twenty-five years.

Unless this basic storyline has been altered by Mr. Gibson, a fringe Catholic who is building his own church in the Los Angeles area and who apparently accepts neither the teachings of Vatican II nor modern biblical scholarship,&nbsp;<em>The Passion of the Christ</em>&nbsp;retains a real potential for undermining the repudiation of classical Christian anti-Semitism by the churches in the last forty years.</p>

<p>For filmmakers to do justice to the biblical accounts of the passion, they must complement their artistic vision with sound scholarship, which includes knowledge of how the passion accounts have been used historically to disparage and attack Jews and Judaism.

They'd come to kill me."&nbsp;In another interview when asked about the scene, he said, "It's one little passage, and I believe it, but I don't and never have believed it refers to Jews, and implicates them in any sort of curse. It's directed at all of us, all men who were there, and all that came after. His blood is on us, and that's what Jesus wanted. But I finally had to admit that one of the reasons I felt strongly about keeping it, aside from the fact it's true, is that I didn't want to let someone else dictate what could or couldn't be said."</dd>
<dd>Additionally, the film's suggestion that the Temple's destruction was a direct result of the Jews' actions towards Jesus could also be interpreted as an offensive take on an event which Jewish tradition views as a tragedy, and which is still mourned by many Jews today on the fast day of&nbsp;<a title="Tisha B'Av" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tisha_B%27Av">Tisha B'Av</a>.</dd>

I want to be as truthful as possible."&nbsp;In an interview in&nbsp;<em><a title="The Globe and Mail" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Globe_and_Mail">The Globe and Mail</a></em>&nbsp;newspaper, he added: "If anyone has distorted Gospel passages to rationalize cruelty towards Jews or anyone, it's in defiance of repeated Papal condemnation.

<dd>Bob Smithouser of Plugged in Online believed that film was trying to convey the evils and sins of humanity rather than specifically targeting Jews, stating: "The anthropomorphic portrayal of Satan as a player in these events brilliantly pulls the proceedings into the supernatural realm&mdash;a fact that should have quelled the much-publicized cries of anti-Semitism since it shows a diabolical force at work beyond any political and religious agendas of the Jews and Romans."</dd>
<dd>Moreover, Senior Vatican officer&nbsp;<a title="Dar&iacute;o Castrill&oacute;n Hoyos" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dar%C3%ADo_Castrill%C3%B3n_Hoyos">Cardinal Dar&iacute;o Castrill&oacute;n Hoyos</a>, who has seen the film, addressed the matter so:</dd>
</dl>
<blockquote>
<p>Anti-Semitism, like all forms of racism, distorts the truth in order to put a whole race of people in a bad light. This film does nothing of the sort. It draws out from the historical objectivity of the Gospel narratives sentiments of forgiveness, mercy, and reconciliation. It captures the subtleties and the horror of sin, as well as the gentle power of love and forgiveness, without making or insinuating blanket condemnations against one group. This film expressed the exact opposite, that learning from the example of Christ, there should never be any more violence against any other human being.</p>

<dd>The new prayer reads as follows:</dd>
<dd><em>Let us also pray for the Jews: That our God and Lord may illuminate their hearts, that they acknowledge Jesus Christ is the Savior of all men.</em>&nbsp;(<em>Let us pray.</em>&nbsp;<em>Kneel.</em>&nbsp;<em>Rise.</em>)&nbsp;<em>Almighty and eternal God, who want that all men be saved and come to the recognition of the truth, propitiously grant that even as the fullness of the peoples enters Thy Church, all Israel be saved.

<dd>Even the new formulation met with reservations from groups such as the Anti-Defamation League.
